## Task description

Review the [CADENCE RVM](https://livecsupomona.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/broncospacelab/Shared%20Documents/CADENCE%20-%20General/Preliminary%20Design%20Review%20(PDR)/Requirements%20Verification%20Matrix%20-%20PDR.xlsx?d=wa895370835e54f139f4a57e748e4a31f&csf=1&web=1&e=fsRUEe) (Requirements Verification Matrix) and the [CONOPS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CF9pmXyayF5Ufs8Ule3L2CbjXw0FUmDb/view?usp=sharing).

Write down what questions you have about them and put them in the software chat. Someone will answer your question (Kai, Kelly, Matt, Pragun, etc.)

Create your own block diagram of what CADENCE looks like to you. Think about how each aspect of the system flows together. Try to create diagrams for what the software might look like. 

Think about different functions and operations the system needs to complete and work them into your software flow and how everything should be connected. What actions need to take place in what order? What things should have control? Why? 

Create these diagrams over the next few weeks. We will review them in the first 2 weeks of summer. We will talk about:

- what is similar between everyone’s approaches?
- what parts do we want to keep and use in the unified CADENCE architecture?
- why you chose to approach the architecture this way. (thought process)

This activity is meant not only to exercise your minds on conceptual thinking, but to combine everyone’s ideas into one unified software architecture for CADENCE.
