# Software Management

Meeting Date: April 23, 2025

Notes:

Waterfall Methodology

- requirements → analysis → design → coding → testing → operations
- each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous ones
- pros
    - clearly links requirements to production
    - useful tool for defining milestones
- cons
    - “make it up before you start, live with the consequences”
    - deadline creep - every phase delays the next
    - hard to conceptualize the entire system early on

Agile Methodology

- originates with software development
- adaptive mindset
- frequent phase transitions
- work divided into iterative cycles
    - ex. time constrained or feature constrained
- pros
    - flexibility for scheduling work
    - ability to correct issues
    - providing releases early (minimum viable product)
- cons
    - “make it up as you go along”
    - ability to rapidly create issues
    - does not inherently guarantee requirements are met

- good to have some kind of test before you switch development environments (dev to flatsat etc.)
