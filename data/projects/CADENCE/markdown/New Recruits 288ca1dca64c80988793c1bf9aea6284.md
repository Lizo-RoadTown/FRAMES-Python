## Outlook Calendar

We require all members to use and update their school Outlook calendar. This makes it easier to schedule meetings and see when people are available. Here’s a guide on how to set this up.

### How to add classes to your calendar

1. In outlook, click “New Event” in the top right corner.

## Importance of Documentation

Documentation is the most important part of working on a team, aside from communication. We have students coming and going over the course of this project, so documenting your work and how you did things and what important decisions you made and why is **majorly important and can make or break a team.**

- write down what you tried - what worked and what didn’t
    - you never know what will be important down the line
    - some problems come up again and again, so having a record of what you did to solve it previously can save so much time
- keep track of resources used during research and development
- make sure your documentation is available to **every team member on the project**
    - save in a shared place (OneDrive, Notion, etc.)
    - ask where something should be saved if you aren’t sure
- write documentation with the expectation that other people will be looking at it to understand what you did
    - they should be able to replicate the results
    - almost like writing a tutorial

### Notion

Using Notion is **required for all members of the team.** 

In general, we use notion for:

- task management
- keeping track of deadlines
- meeting notes
- informal documentation

Feel free to make your own pages in your sub-team sections.

Ask Kelly or your lead if you have questions about Notion.

### OneDrive

All of our more formal documentation goes here. For every milestone or review, we make a new folder for the documents required to be submitted to UNP.

We have templates for Word documents and PowerPoint presentations that we use. 

- Just make a copy of an existing document to re-use the template.

### GitHub

We use GitHub for more than just code. We use it for:

- hardware designs, schematic files and PCB files
- (eventually) formal documentation on technical work (think of a how-to guide)
- beyond flight software, we use it for GMAT simulation code

Kelly should have sent you an invitation to join the BroncoSpace-Lab community on GitHub. There, you can see every CADENCE repository that we have so far. 

As we progress in design and development, we will be using the GitHub more and more, so make sure you familiarize yourself with it.

## Communication and Discord Usage

Communication, along with documentation, is **the most important aspect about working in a team**. We primarily use Discord for text communication.

All project-related discussions over text must happen in the CADENCE Discord Server.

- This is primarily to keep a record of important discussions
- Also great to keep things in one place so other team members can have the same updated information
- You can use DM for personal conversations with project members, but any and all project discussions must be held in the server.
