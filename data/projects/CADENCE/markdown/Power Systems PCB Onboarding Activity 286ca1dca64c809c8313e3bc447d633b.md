## Welcome to the Power Systems Team!

As your first task for the team, we should familiarize ourselves with the following to understand what we do and how we plan to progress through the project. 

We will be starting by watching videos from Phil’s Lab to understand PCB Board designing using Notion for documentation and GitHub and KiCad for the design process.

## **Do each of the following below:**

## Learn documentation through Notion

Notion is key to our team’s project management, communication, and documentation! Once going through this video, you will have a more solid understanding of how to use Notion. Our expectation is that you will learn to at least create, insert, and move blocks as needed. 

When formatting your log, it is suggested that you turn them into Toggle Headers with the date and name of the activity. 

EX) 10/08/25 Power PCB Onboarding Activity

NOTE: You may document in your designated logs. For any changes in the Notion and task tracker, you **MUST** have prior approval. **Do NOT change any of the due dates from the tasks given.**

## Learn how to design PCBs using KiCad

To learn the basics of PCB design through KiCad, watch through the video and take notes of how to do each step onto Notion. This tutorial will be a good way to understand the program and will be useful having notes for later.

## Create and learn the works of GitHub

On the Resources, your will be going through the introduction for GitHub. Follow the instructions and start the course:
