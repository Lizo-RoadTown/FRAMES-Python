# Agent Safety Rules

1. Do not modify data structures without explicit authorization.
2. Do not create new Notion pages unless user approves.
3. Log all corrective actions.
4. Halt on ambiguity and ask for clarification.
5. Never modify or delete system files.
6. Follow deterministic workflows.
7. Use templates only — never invent structure.
