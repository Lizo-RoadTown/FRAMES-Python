# Student & Faculty README

## Overview
This platform gives you a clear, structured, and accurate way to learn the engineering skills needed to contribute to your team. Every module is created from real engineering workflows—so what you learn is exactly what your teammates are doing.

---

## What You Get

- Short, focused learning modules  
- Step-by-step procedures  
- Real examples from your team’s tools  
- Hints, explanations, and guided reasoning  
- Automatic progress tracking  
- Mobile-friendly LMS access  
- A consistent onboarding experience  

---

## Where Modules Come From

Modules are automatically generated from:

- Team documentation  
- Engineering tasks  
- Test procedures  
- Logs and decisions  
- Subsystem workflows in tools like Notion or GitHub  

A structured integration layer and React-based editor ensure the learning content is clean, accurate, and up to date with actual engineering work.
