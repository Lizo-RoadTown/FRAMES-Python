# For Students — What is Ascent Basecamp?

**Target Audience:** Students joining engineering teams (CubeSat, robotics, aerospace projects) who need to learn technical skills quickly.

---

## What This Platform Does for You

**Ascent Basecamp** is your personal training system for learning everything you need to contribute to your engineering team—without the confusion, overwhelm, or "just Google it" approach that leaves you guessing.

Think of it as:
- **Your roadmap** from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to "I can actually help the team"
- **Training modules** created by people who've already done the work (not generic tutorials)
- **Progress tracking** that shows you're making progress (even when it doesn't feel like it)
- **A reference library** you can return to when you forget something

**No grades. No tests. No judgment.**

Just clear, step-by-step guidance on the skills your team actually needs.

---

## Why This Exists (The Real Story)

### The Problem You've Probably Experienced

You join an engineering team. Everyone's busy. You want to help, but:

- **You don't know what you don't know.** Where do you even start?
- **Documentation is scattered.** Some in Notion, some in Google Docs, some in someone's head.
- **Mentors are swamped.** They want to help but don't have time to explain everything from scratch.
- **You feel behind.** Everyone else seems to know what they're doing.

So you spend weeks feeling lost, asking the same questions others asked last semester, and not actually building anything.

### The Solution: Structured Onboarding

Ascent Basecamp fixes this by:

1. **Giving you a clear path.** Modules are organized by subsystem (Power, Structures, Avionics, etc.) and difficulty level.
2. **Teaching you what your team actually uses.** No generic "Intro to Arduino" courses. This is "How We Flash Firmware on Our Flight Computer."
3. **Letting you learn at your own pace.** Mobile-friendly, works on your phone, saves your progress.
4. **Making knowledge reusable.** When you graduate, your learning doesn't disappear. Future students build on what you learned.

---

## How It Works (The Student Experience)

### Step 1: Browse Modules

When you log in, you see modules organized by **subsystem** (the part of the project you're working on):

- **Power** → Battery sizing, EPS characterization, solar panel testing
- **Structures** → CAD modeling, 3D printing, vibration testing
- **Avionics** → Firmware flashing, sensor integration, telemetry debugging
- **Thermal** → Heat dissipation, thermal modeling
- **Communications** → Antenna design, signal analysis
- **Payload** → Mission-specific instruments

Each subsystem has:
- **Orientation modules** (start here if you're new)
- **Competency modules** (core skills you need)
- **Integration modules** (how your subsystem connects to others)
- **Autonomy modules** (advanced/leadership skills)

---

### Step 2: Start a Module

Click a module and you'll see:

**Module Overview:**
- What you'll learn (learning objectives)
- How long it takes (estimated time, usually 30-90 minutes)
- What you need to know first (prerequisites)

**Sections:**
Each module is broken into **small sections** (5-10 minutes each):
- **Reading sections** — Background knowledge
- **Exercise sections** — Hands-on practice
- **Quiz sections** — Check your understanding (not graded!)

**Why small sections?**
- You can do one section, take a break, come back later
- Progress is saved automatically
- You see progress with every section (motivation boost)

---

### Step 3: Work Through Sections

Each section has:

**Content:**
- Clear explanations (text, images, videos)
- Step-by-step instructions for exercises
- Real examples from your team's actual work

**Checks (Optional):**
- Quick validation questions ("Did this work?")
- Not graded—just to help you confirm you're on track

**Hints (If You Get Stuck):**
- Progressive hints (start vague, get more specific)
- "Think about..." prompts to guide your thinking
- Links to external resources if needed

**Example:**
```
Section: "Flash Firmware to Development Board"

Step 1: Connect board via USB
  → Check: "Does your computer recognize the board?"
  → Hint: "Check Device Manager (Windows) or lsusb (Linux)"

Step 2: Open Arduino IDE and select board type
  → Check: "Do you see the board in Tools > Board menu?"
  → Hint: "You may need to install board definitions first"

Step 3: Upload blink program
  → Check: "Is the LED blinking?"
  → Hint: "If upload fails, check COM port selection"
```

You work through each step, check your progress, and move on when ready.

---

### Step 4: Track Your Progress

**Your Dashboard shows:**
- Modules completed (with completion %)
- Time spent learning
- Subsystem progress (how far you are in Power, Avionics, etc.)
- Recommended next modules (based on what you've finished)

**Competency Levels (per subsystem):**
- **Orientation** → You understand the basics
- **Competency** → You can work independently on standard tasks
- **Integration** → You understand how your work affects other teams
- **Autonomy** → You can train others and make decisions

**Example:**
```
Your Progress:

Power Subsystem: Competency (60% complete)
  ✅ Power Orientation
  ✅ Battery Sizing Fundamentals
  ✅ EPS Characterization
  🔲 Solar Panel Integration
  🔲 Power Budget Analysis

Avionics Subsystem: Orientation (25% complete)
  ✅ Avionics Orientation
  🔲 Firmware Flashing Fundamentals
  🔲 Sensor Integration
```

## Special Feature: Race Mode (Optional)

Want to make learning competitive? Enable **Race Mode**:

### What It Is
You race against **"ghost cohorts"**—students from previous semesters who completed the same modules.

### How It Works
- Timer starts when you begin a module
- You see checkpoints (e.g., "50% of students finish Section 1 in 10 minutes")
- Real-time comparison: Are you faster or slower than the ghosts?
- Final time displayed with ranking (Fast/Medium/Slow compared to historical data)

### Why It's Fun
- Adds urgency (makes you focus)
- Shows you're competitive with past students
- Bragging rights if you beat the fast cohort

### Why It's Optional
- Some people learn better without pressure
- You can toggle Race Mode on/off anytime
- Your progress is saved either way

## What Makes This Different from YouTube Tutorials?

### YouTube/Google:
- Generic content not specific to your team
- You have to figure out what's relevant
- No progress tracking
- No guarantee it's current or accurate
- Can't ask questions

### Ascent Basecamp:
- **Content created by your team** (using your actual equipment/procedures)
- **Organized learning path** (you don't have to guess what to learn next)
- **Progress tracking** (you can see you're making progress)
- **Always up-to-date** (team leads update modules when procedures change)
- **Built-in support** (hints, checks, links to mentors)

---

## FAQ

### Do I have to complete modules in order?
**Mostly, yes.** Some modules have **prerequisites** (you need to finish Module A before Module B). This ensures you have foundational knowledge before tackling advanced topics.

But you can usually work on multiple subsystems at once (e.g., Power + Avionics).

---

### What if I already know some of this?
**Skip ahead!** If you're already familiar with a topic, you can:
- Skim the reading sections
- Jump to the quiz/exercise to confirm you know it
- Mark it complete and move on

The system tracks what you've done, so you get credit.

---

### Are modules graded?
**No.** This is not a class. There are no grades, no tests, no failure.

The quizzes and checks are **for you** to confirm you understand. If you get something wrong, you see hints and try again. That's it.

---

### Can I do modules on my phone?
**Yes!** Ascent Basecamp is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, which means:
- Works on mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari)
- Responsive design (adjusts to screen size)
- Can install as an app icon on your home screen
- Works offline (once you've loaded a module)

Perfect for learning during commutes, breaks, or whenever you have spare time.

---

### What if I get stuck?
**Multiple layers of support:**

1. **Hints in the module** (click "Show Hint" for progressive guidance)
2. **External resources** (links to datasheets, documentation, videos)
3. **Ask your mentor** (module shows who created it—reach out to them)
4. **Team lead dashboard** (they can see where you're stuck and offer help)

---

### How long does it take to complete a subsystem?
**Depends on the subsystem and your background.**

Typical estimates:
- **Orientation level:** 2-4 hours (basic understanding)
- **Competency level:** 10-20 hours (can work independently)
- **Integration level:** 5-10 hours (understand cross-team dependencies)
- **Autonomy level:** 10-15 hours (leadership/advanced skills)

**Total per subsystem:** 25-50 hours

**But remember:** You don't have to finish everything. Focus on what your team needs you to know.

---

### Can I revisit modules later?
**Absolutely!** Ascent Basecamp is designed as a **reference library**.

- Forgot how to flash firmware? Go back to that module.
- Need to double-check a procedure? All modules stay accessible.
- Want to refresh before a test/review? Use it as study material.

The system tracks "revisits" separately from first completions, so you can return anytime.

## What Happens After You Complete Modules?

### 1. You Get Access to Real Work
Your team lead can see your progress. When you complete relevant modules, they know you're ready to:
- Join subsystem meetings
- Take on actual tasks (not just "learning")
- Contribute to mission-critical work

### 2. You Become a Mentor
Next semester, new students will learn from **modules you helped validate**. Some teams even have experienced students:
- Update modules with new procedures
- Add troubleshooting tips based on their experience
- Create new modules for emerging topics

### 3. Your Data Helps Future Students
(Anonymously) Your learning patterns help researchers understand:
- Which modules are too hard (need better scaffolding)
- Which sections cause confusion (need clarification)
- Which prerequisite chains work best

This makes the system better for everyone.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Get Access
Your team lead will:
- Create your student account
- Assign you to your university/team
- Assign required modules (if any)

### 2. Log In
Go to: [Your Ascent Basecamp URL]
- Use your university email
- Set a password

### 3. Start Learning
- Browse modules by subsystem
- Start with Orientation modules
- Work through sections at your own pace
- Track your progress on the dashboard

### 4. Ask for Help When Stuck
- Use in-module hints
- Reach out to your mentor
- Check team lead dashboard (they can see where you are)

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Do a Little Every Day
**Better:** 30 minutes/day for 5 days (2.5 hours total)
**Worse:** 5 hours in one marathon session (burnout + poor retention)

Small, consistent progress > cramming.

---

### 2. Actually Do the Exercises
**Don't skip hands-on sections.** Reading ≠ learning.

- If a module says "Flash firmware to a board," do it.
- If it says "Calculate a power budget," actually calculate it.
- If it says "Run this command," run it and see what happens.

---

### 3. Use Race Mode Strategically
- **Turn it ON** if you need motivation/focus
- **Turn it OFF** if it stresses you out

There's no shame in going at your own pace.

---

### 4. Revisit When Needed
If you complete a module but forget the details weeks later:
- **Go back and skim it.** It's faster the second time.
- **Treat it as a reference manual,** not just a one-time course.

---

### 5. Give Feedback
See a typo? Confusing section? Outdated procedure?

- Tell your team lead
- Or leave a comment (if the system supports it)

Your feedback makes modules better for future students.

---
