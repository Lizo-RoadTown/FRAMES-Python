# Agent Omega - Execution Log

**Agent Role**: The Great Executor
**Environment**: Windows Desktop, Direct System Access
**Status**: OPERATIONAL

---

## Session 1 - Initial Bootup
**Date**: 2025-12-04
**Time**: Initial boot sequence

### Connection Status
✅ **Neon Database**: CONNECTED
- URL: postgresql://neondb_owner@ep-rapid-wave-afzareik-pooler.c-2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb
- Tables Found: 39 tables
- Universities: 0
- Teams: 0
- Students: 0

✅ **Notion API**: CONNECTED
- API Key: Active
- Users: 3 in workspace
- Databases: 0 (workspace may be empty or needs initialization)

✅ **GitHub**: CONNECTED
- Repository: FRAMES-Python
- Branch: main
- Status: Up to date with origin/main

### Canon Files Read
✅ Completed reading core canonical documentation:
- `canon/README.md` - Index of 14 canonical documents
- `canon/INDEX.md` - V2 transition status
- `canon/OPERATIONAL_ONTOLOGY.md` - Practical operational definitions
- `canon/system_overview_v_2.md` - System architecture
- `canon/agent_interaction_script_v_2.md` - Agent coordination protocols
- `canon/Notion_Interface_layer.md` - Notion rules and boundaries
- `AGENT_OMEGA_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Omega role definition
- `OMEGA_DELTA_FEEDBACK_SYSTEM.md` - Feedback loop protocols

### Key Understandings
1. **My Role as Omega**: The Great Executor
   - Primary responsibility: Execute approved plans from Planning Trio (Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
   - Capabilities: Database operations, infrastructure scripts, Notion operations, coordination
   - Coordination: Assign tasks to Delta (Cursor IDE agent), verify outputs
   - Maximum system access: Direct file system, database, Notion API, Python execution

2. **Operational Constraints**:
   - Follow OPERATIONAL_ONTOLOGY strictly - no improvisation
   - Notion is an observation surface, not a workspace for agents
   - Modules live in PostgreSQL database, NOT in Notion
   - All actions must derive from observable data
   - Validate before any irreversible action

3. **Agent System Architecture**:
   - **Planning Trio** (VS Code): Alpha (Content), Beta (Application), Gamma (Infrastructure)
   - **Human Mediator** (Liz): Reviews plans, approves execution
   - **Execution Layer**: Omega (backend, DB, coordination) + Delta (frontend, UI testing)

4. **Notion Interface Rules**:
   - Read: Unrestricted
   - Write: Only in explicit agent-safe regions
   - Never restructure, reformat, or create pages without explicit permission
   - Notion is a measurement device, not a canonical data store

### Workspace Setup
✅ Created Omega workspace directories:
- `omega_workspace/current_execution/` - Active tasks
- `omega_workspace/completed_tasks/` - Task archives
- `omega_workspace/delta_assignments/` - Tasks for Delta agent

### System State Assessment
**Database**: 39 tables exist but no data (Universities: 0, Teams: 0, Students: 0)
**Notion**: Connected but may need initialization (0 databases found)
**Codebase**: Clean working tree, up to date with origin

### Ready for Execution
I am now fully operational and ready to:
1. Receive approved plans from Planning Trio
2. Execute database operations (migrations, seeding)
3. Run infrastructure scripts
4. Coordinate Delta's work
5. Report progress and feedback

### Next Steps Recommended
1. **High Priority**: Bootstrap database with initial schema/data
2. **High Priority**: Set up Notion workspace structure if needed
3. **Medium Priority**: Populate ghost_cohorts table (Alpha/Beta waiting on this)
4. **Medium Priority**: Verify all 39 tables have correct schema

## Awaiting Instructions
Status: Ready and awaiting approved plan from Planning Trio or direct instruction from Human (Liz).

**Capabilities Verified**: ✅ All systems operational
**Canon Compliance**: ✅ All canonical documents read and internalized
**Workspace Ready**: ✅ Directory structure created
**Connection Status**: ✅ All services connected (Neon, Notion, GitHub)
