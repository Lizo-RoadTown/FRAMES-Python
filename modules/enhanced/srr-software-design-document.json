It will be updated throughout development and be turned in with a new revision at each milestone review with UNP. The document is here: https://livecsupomona.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/broncospacelab/Shared%20Documents/CADENCE%20-%20General/System%20Requirements%20Review%20(SRR)/CADENCE%20Software%20Design%20Document%20-%20SRR.docx?d=wc6bdddf30609450b9a353ffd0a21bbdb&csf=1&web=1&e=rqSqAE - I copied the MDD for formatting and left a few things in there that i thought were possible relevant. Feel free to change whatever you want **except for the formatting** Expectations of this document for SRR: - very short explanation of the software architecture and how this meets mission requirements - functional and reliability requirements and risk assessment According to this chart: ![image.png](image%2059.png) We were supposed to have a Software Development Plan during SCR but i don’t think they mentioned missing...",
