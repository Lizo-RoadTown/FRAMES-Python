# FRAMES Philosophy & Purpose

FRAMES was built to solve a set of recurring problems common in multi-university engineering programs:

- Students enter with uneven preparation.
- Knowledge lives in scattered documents and personal communication.
- Critical processes are explained verbally but rarely documented.
- When students graduate, knowledge disappears with them.
- Faculty cannot easily see what students understand or where they struggle.
- Mentors repeat the same teaching every semester because there is no shared system.

These aren’t failures of individuals. They’re structural issues.  
FRAMES exists to address them directly.

## 1. What FRAMES Is

FRAMES is a unified ecosystem composed of:

- One PostgreSQL database shared across students, teams, and faculty.
- Three applications built on top of that shared data:
  - Student Onboarding LMS — structured learning modules with analytics.
  - Team Lead Module Builder — tools for creating and refining those modules.
  - Researcher & Faculty Platform — dashboards for understanding team behavior, learning patterns, and long-term program health.
- A controlled AI agent layer that helps with consistency, formatting, and structure — without creating uncontrolled content or new pages.

## 2. Why FRAMES Exists (The Human Side)

Even though FRAMES is a technical system, its purpose is deeply practical and human-centered.

It helps:

### Students
- Know exactly what to learn next.
- Understand real project tools and workflows.
- Build confidence instead of guessing or “catching up” silently.

### Mentors / Team Leads
- Reduce repetitive teaching.
- Ensure every student receives the same baseline.
- Build modules once instead of re-explaining every semester.

### Faculty
- See actual student progression.
- Spot gaps early.
- Identify where additional support is needed.

### Researchers
- Access consistent datasets on learning, collaboration, and team structure.
- Study patterns across semesters and universities.

FRAMES does **not** replace human instruction.  
It reinforces it by making routine processes consistent and essential processes visible.

## 3. Research Foundations

FRAMES is grounded in established research fields:

### Non-Decomposable Architecture (NDA)
Models communication, collaboration, and handoff patterns across teams — useful for predicting weak points or missing interfaces.

### Learning Science & Cognitive Load Theory
Guides how modules are structured so students can learn technical material without being overwhelmed.

### Time-on-Task & Learning Analytics
Captures not just whether students completed modules, but *how* they engaged with them.

### Knowledge Transfer & Retention Theory
Addresses the persistent issue of expertise disappearing when students graduate.

## 4. How Everything Fits Together

### One Database
Everyone interacts with the same data structure, which keeps the entire program aligned.

### Three Applications
Each one serves a different group but pulls from the same information.

### AI Agents
Used carefully and intentionally:
- Maintain formatting, consistency, and documentation.
- Help transform Notion pages into structured training modules.
- Operate under strict rules to avoid uncontrolled behavior.

## 5. What FRAMES Ultimately Provides

- A clear path for new students.
- Continuity for teams.
- Efficiency for mentors.
- Visibility for faculty.
- Structured data for researchers.
- A stable environment for controlled AI assistance.
